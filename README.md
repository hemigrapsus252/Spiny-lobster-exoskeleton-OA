Abstract: 
Spiny lobsters rely on multiple exoskeletal predator defenses that may be sensitive to ocean
acidification (OA). Compromised mechanical integrity of these defensive structures may tilt predator
prey outcomes, leading to increased mortality in the lobsters’ environment. Here, we tested the effects of
OA-like conditions on the mechanical integrity of selected exoskeletal defenses of juvenile California
spiny lobster, Panulirus interruptus. Young spiny lobsters reside in kelp forests with dynamic carbonate
chemistry due to local metabolism and photosynthesis as well as seasonal upwelling, yielding daily and
seasonal fluctuations in pH. Lobsters were exposed to a series of stable and diurnally fluctuating reduced
pH conditions for three months (ambient pH/stable, 7.97; reduced pH/stable 7.67; reduced pH with low
fluctuations, 7.67 ± 0.05; reduced pH with high fluctuations, 7.67 ± 0.10), after which we examined the
intermolt composition (Ca and Mg content), ultrastructure (cuticle and layer thickness), and mechanical
properties (hardness and stiffness) of selected exoskeletal predator defenses. Cuticle ultrastructure was
consistently robust to pH conditions, while mineralization and mechanical properties were variable.
Notably, the carapace was less mineralized under both reduced pH treatments with fluctuations, but with
no effect on material properties, and the rostral horn had lower hardness in reduced/high fluctuating
conditions without a corresponding difference in mineralization. Antennal flexural stiffness was lower in
reduced, stable pH conditions compared to the reduced pH treatment with high fluctuations and not
correlated with changes in cuticle structure or mineralization. These results demonstrate a complex
relationship between mineralization and mechanical properties of the exoskeleton under changing ocean
chemistry, and that fluctuating reduced pH conditions can induce responses not observed under the stable
reduced pH conditions often used in OA research. Furthermore, this study shows that some juvenile
California spiny lobster exoskeletal defenses are responsive to changes in ocean carbonate chemistry,
even during the intermolt period, in ways that can potentially increase susceptibility to predation among
this critical life stage.
